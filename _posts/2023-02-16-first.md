This is the first post on this blog! 

This blog will follow the development of a physics simulation project in the course DD1354 Models and Simulations at KTH. 

The project aims to simulate a Galton Board. This is a toy where metal balls are dropped onto pegs that are arranged in a triangle-pattern. On each peg, the ball bounces of the peg and if it is calibrated(well built enough), there is roughly a 50/50 chance that the ball moves either to the right or to the left on each bounce. Each ball follows a binomial distribution $$X \sim Bin(n, p)$$ where $n$ is the number of rows in the board, and $p$ is the chance of a bounce in either direction, i.e 0.5.

Together, all balls approximate a Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the binomial distribution (and given enough balls, a normal distribution).

See below for a picture on how it can look like.
