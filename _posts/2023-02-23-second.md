Today we got feedback on our project specification by Chris himself: 

"Excellent specification! The project idea is very good (great scenario) and is 
open to 'A' grade, depending of course on reporting. But since this project usually 
involves integrating a number of different physical forces together, for an 'A' grade, 
try to find one specific aspect of the physics simulation that you can go deep into, especially 
in the report (background equations, etc) and possibly in the implementation."

We are very excited that our idea is ambitious enough to qualify for a possible A grade. 
It was especially helpful to have emphasised that we need to focus on the physics simulation. 
The initial idea is to ensure that we pay close attention to the elastic collisions of the balls.
