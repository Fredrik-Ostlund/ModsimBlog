Today we started brainstorming and formulating a plan about how to attack this project. 

The main challenge is that neither of us have much experience with Unity, so the task seems
rather daunting since it's such a massive and versatile tool. 

We agreed to focus on having a "minimum viable product" ready and focus on the core behaviour 
(i.e. not spending all our project time on making the textures look fancy). 

We looked back on the previous labs that we had done in the course to try to take some inspiration, 
and also researched some basic tutorials and guides on the web. Of course we also looked into
some of the past project blogs for inspiration, but more often than not they only contained 
some images and text, and not the nitty gritty details about the implementations. 

In any case we are sure that we will manage to create something satisfying in the end!
