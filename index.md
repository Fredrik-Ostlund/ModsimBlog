# 2023-02-16 First post!

This blog will follow the development of a physics simulation project in the course DD1354 Models and Simulations at KTH. 

The project aims to simulate a Galton Board. This is a toy where metal balls are dropped onto pegs that are arranged in a triangle-pattern. On each peg, the ball bounces of the peg and if it is calibrated(well built enough), there is roughly a 50/50 chance that the ball moves either to the right or to the left on each bounce. Each ball follows a binomial distribution **X~Bin(n, p)** where **n** is the number of rows in the board, and **p** is the chance of a bounce in either direction, i.e 0.5.

Together, all balls approximate a Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the binomial distribution (and given enough balls, a normal distribution).

See below for a picture on how it can look like.

We intend to implement this in Unity, without the help of built in physics engine. That is, we will try to do everything physics-related from scratch. The main physics components will be
 * Simulating gravity
 * Elastic collisions (meaning that no energy is lost within the system due to the collision) of two kinds:
     * ball-to-ball collisions, where the balls should react to eachother depending on their relative speeds and masses
     * ball-to-pin-collisions, where the pins are considered fixed, and the balls should bounce off them depending on angle and speed
 * Normal force, counteracting gravity when the balls become stationary on the ground
